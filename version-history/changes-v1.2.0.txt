    -Comp
        -Id() => ID()
    -Container
        -ById() => ByID()
    -HasUrl => HasURL
        -Url() => URL()
        -SetUrl() => SetURL()
    -Html => HTML
        -NewHtml() => NewHTML()
        -Html() => HTML()
        -SetHtml() => SetHTML()
    -Server
        -AppUrl() => AppURL()
        -AddRootHeadHtml() => AddRootHeadHTML()
        -RemoveRootHeadHtml() => RemoveRootHeadHTML()

        -Id() => ID()
    -Window
        -AddHeadHtml() => AddHeadHTML()
        -RemoveHeadHtml() => RemoveHeadHTML()
        -SetFocusedCompId() => SetFocusedCompID()

-Renamed github.com/icza/gowut/examples to _examples, making it excluded from
build tools by default. You can still run the examples using "go run".

-Window list has been rewritten to use Gowut components.

-Encoded form of AppPath is used when specifying Cookie paths.
For details, see https://github.com/icza/gowut/issues/27

-Session creation and removal messages are now only logged with log.Println()
if no logger is set at the Server.
For details, see https://github.com/icza/gowut.dev/issues/7

-Development of gowut has moved from gowut.dev project to the dev branch of
the gowut project.
